# A-Last-Call-To-Arms: A Research Repository
## This research will be used to create a full-length non-fiction book which explains what Western Civilization is and how it works. 

Ideally, any person who reads this book, even if they have no knowledge of Western Civilization, could understand what it is, how it works, its values and ideals, and be able to reconstruct its most valuable features and institutions. 

# Why the Inflammatory Title?
- The title of this book, "A Last Call to Arms" is meant to portray the seriousness of the situation.
- This metaphorical "call to arms" is supposed to be a rallying cry to push those who love Western Civilization to work urgently to save Her.
- In addition to being the "last call", this book also provides the "arms"-- the strategies and information needed in order to get the job done.

## Main Audience

The target audience for this book are younger men, ages 16-35, who are socially active, and politically moderate, conservative, or libertarian. 

- **Men**: Men are the main consumers of non-fiction which is not within the "self-help" genre, so they seem an obvious target market. In addition, men are disproportionately interested in History, at least in the English-speaking market.
- **16-25**: Since the book will have a large identity component to it, I believe it makes most sense to cater to an audience that is most likely to be asking questions about their own identity, and where they fit in the world.
- **Socially Active**: While it may be that a book which caters to people who are less socially active might have a greater spread online, it is better to have knowledge catered to those who are in the best position to use it in a helpful way. 
- **Moderate, Conservative, Libertarian**: Though these three audiences have some differences, I believe they will find the book compelling and worth sharing with their peers. I feel that Liberals, Progressives, Socialists, Communists, and related groups might find some of the material offensive and be less likely to engage with it in a good-faith way.

### How the Audience Effects the Book

- **Hard Upper Limit of 800 Pages**: A socially active demographic is likely to have many commitments outside of reading, and may find the idea of completing an 800 page book quite daunting. _The majority of men I surveyed state that they prefer a book closer to 250 pages._
- **Short Sections**: Socially active young men have a large variety of outside engagement which limit their reading time, and they may be used to shorter form content found on sites like tiktok, twitter, or things like tiktok or memes. For this reason, sections should be short and be able to be read, more or less, on their own.
- **Reduced Number of Emotional Appeals**: While men do respond to emotional appeals, they are more likely to view them as manipulative than women, and so they should be limited in number and scope, and avoid focusing on things which could be termed "excessive safetyism" or "political correctness".
- **Clear Arguments backed by Facts**: A male audience is more likely to respond to facts and figures, but the active man will also prefer clear and concrete arguments he can share when talking about the book with friends.
