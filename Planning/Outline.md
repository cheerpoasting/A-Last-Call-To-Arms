The types of questions that are often asked: 
- "Does something exist? What kind of thing is it? What caused it to exist, or under what conditions can it exist, or why does it exist? What purpose does it serve? What are the consequences of its existence? What are its characteristic properties, its typical traits? What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort? How does it behave? These are all theoritical questions"
- "What ends should be sought? What means should be chosen to a given end? What things must one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order? Under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse? Under What conditions would it be better to do this rather than that? These are all practical questions"

- Created huge scientific progress.
- Developed Libertarian Ethics.
- Developed the Protestant Work Ethic.

## Development of Western Civ Over Time
- **"Cosmogenesis":** What were the roots of the West?
    - How did the PIE and the Pre-Europeans create the Indo-Europeans?
    - The genetic clines in Europe
    - The Bronze Age Collapse
    - The Rise of Greece & Rome, the effects of the Roman Empire
    - Christianization, the Catholic Church, the Feudal system
    - How Guilds replaced Clans as Catholicism expanded

- JD Unwin's Hypothesis of Marriage Patterns
- Civilization as a shared narrative and religious history - show how PIE narrative influence continues today.
- Civilization as producing science and technology
- Have systems of Morality and Ethics
# Civilization as Time Preference
- People often define others as "civilized" when they share a large number of cultural features. This method is too culturally dependent to be useful.
- Time preference is a culturally neutral method of determining how civilized different cultures are, as well as different groups within those cultures.
- "Civilized" groups are those with long-time preference (called "low time preference" in the literature): they control their impulses, delay gratification, and plan for the future.
	- *call this "future orientation" and "immediate gratification"?*
- Time Preference is a "leading indicator": it reliably predicts or foreshadows future changes in a society.
	- Cultures that sustain this long-time preference develop over time into civilizations.
	- Cultures that develop short-time preference (called "high time preference" in the literature) begin to decay and are in danger of collapsing.
- The longer a group is civilized, the more likely they are to create a well developed civilization, as it is commonly understood.
	- There is a division of labor that leads to specialization and the compounding of knowledge. They will build on previous discoveries in math, science, craftsmanship, and the arts.
	- Systems of education are developed in various forms. 
	- A form of self-identity emerges: a series of customs, expectations, religious beliefs, language, myths, and legends.
