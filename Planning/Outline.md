# Why the Inflammatory Title?
- The title of this book, "A Last Call to Arms" is meant to portray the seriousness of the situation.
- This metaphorical "call to arms" is supposed to be a rallying cry to push those who love Western Civilization to work urgently to save Her.
- In addition to being the "last call", this book also provides the "arms"-- the strategies and information needed in order to get the job done.
# Civilization is Time Preference
- People often define others as "civilized" when they share a large number of cultural features. This method is too culturally dependent to be useful.
- Time preference is a culturally neutral method of determining how civilized different cultures are, as well as different groups within those cultures.
- "Civilized" groups are those with long-time preference (called "low time preference" in the literature): they control their impulses, delay gratification, and plan for the future.
	- *call this "future orientation" and "immediate gratification"?*
- Time Preference is a "leading indicator": it reliably predicts or foreshadows future changes in a society.
	- Cultures that sustain this long-time preference develop over time into civilizations.
	- Cultures that develop short-time preference (called "high time preference" in the literature) begin to decay and are in danger of collapsing.
- The longer a group is civilized, the more likely they are to create a well developed civilization, as it is commonly understood.
	- There is a division of labor that leads to specialization and the compounding of knowledge. They will build on previous discoveries in math, science, craftsmanship, and the arts.
	- Systems of education are developed in various forms. 
	- A form of self-identity emerges: a series of customs, expectations, religious beliefs, language, myths, and legends.
